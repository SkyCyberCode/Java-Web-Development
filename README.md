# Java Web Development

This repository is dedicated to **mastering Java Web Development** â€” from the fundamentals to advanced frameworks and real-world integrations.  
Iâ€™m building a **solid foundation** in **Java SE**, **Web**, **Spring**, **Security**, and **AI integrations**,  
with a strong focus on writing **clean**, **secure**, and **scalable** software.

I aim to **share the projects I build** and **document my learning journey** along the way.
