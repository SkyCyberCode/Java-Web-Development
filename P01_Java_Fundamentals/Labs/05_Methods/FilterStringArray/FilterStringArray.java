/*
Implement console program which will meet the following requirements:

a- Program starts and asks user to enter random words separated by space
b- Program asks user to enter minimum length of string to filter words which were entered
c- Program creates array object from entered words
d- Program calls specific method which takes String[] as a parameter and returns array of strings which contains words that have length more or equal to value specified by user

Method should look like this:
public static String[] filterWordsByLength(int minLength, String[] words) {

             <write your code here>
      }

e. Program prints filtered array to the console output.

/*
Explanation:
    ** First of all, I'm using VS Code :) **

- This program filters words based on minimum length specified by user

## Program flow:
1- Ask user to enter words separated by spaces
2- Ask user for minimum word length to filter
3- Split input string into array of words
4- Filter words that meet the length requirement
5- Print the filtered words

## Key method: filterWordsByLength()
**First loop**: 
- Counts how many words meet the length requirement
- This helps create new array with exact size needed

**Second loop**:
- Creates new array with the counted size
- Copies only words that are long enough
- Uses index variable to track position in new array

## Important details:
- split("\\s+") handles multiple spaces between words
- Two-pass approach: first count, then copy
- This avoids creating array that's too big or too small

ðŸ“ŒNote: The program only keeps words that are equal or longer than minimum length
